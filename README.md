# Air quality bot

## About

This is my first project in Kotlin.<br>
It's a bot for Telegram that gets a location and sends a picture<br>
with the air quality in that area. It is not a commercial project<br>
and is made just for practice.<br>
Inspired by the beautiful city of Almaty, Kazakhstan.

3. Run docker compose:

4. You are magnificent! Try sending your telegram bot a location.
